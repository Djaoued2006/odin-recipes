       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li><em>Start by preparing the chickpeas. Soak them in water overnight, then cook them until they are tender. If you're using canned chickpeas, you can skip this step.</em></li>
        <li><em>In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent.</em></li>
        <li><em>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute or so, until it becomes fragrant</em></li>
        <li><em>Add the ground cumin, ginger, paprika, cinnamon, and turmeric. Stir well and cook for a couple of minutes to release the flavors.</em></li>
        <li><em>Add the diced tomatoes and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.</em></li>
        <li><em>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, and add the cooked chickpeas and lentils. Season with salt and black pepper.</em></li>
        <li><em>Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.</em></li>
        <li><em>Add the vermicelli or broken angel hair pasta to the soup and cook for another 5-7 minutes, or until they are tender</em></li>
        <li><em>Stir in the fresh cilantro, parsley, and coriander. Save some for garnish if desired.</em></li>
        <li><em>Squeeze in the juice of one lemon and stir well.</em></li>
        <li><em>Taste the soup and adjust the seasonings as needed.</em></li>
        <li><em>Serve the hrira hot, garnished with lemon wedges, additional fresh herbs, and, if you like, hard-boiled eggs. You can also add some harissa or hot sauce for extra heat.</em></li>
       </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your homemade hrira soup! It's a hearty and flavorful dish that's perfect for a comforting meal.</p>
